🚀 Agent-Guided Explainable Compressor (AGEC)

Agent-Guided Explainable Summarization using Small Language Models (SLMs)
A resource-efficient, explainable, and hallucination-free extractive summarization system guided by reinforcement learning.
📌 Overview

Text summarization systems today face a critical trade-off between:

Quality (LLMs generate fluent summaries but hallucinate),

Efficiency (LLMs are expensive and GPU-heavy),

Explainability (black-box generation is not auditable).

AGEC (Agent-Guided Explainable Compressor) resolves this trade-off by combining:

✅ Small Language Models (SLMs) for efficiency

✅ Extractive summarization for factual traceability

✅ Reinforcement Learning (RL) for intelligent sentence selection

✅ SEval-Ex factual evaluator for statement-level verification

After training, only the optimized SLM is required during inference, enabling deployment on CPU-only and edge devices.

🧠 Key Contributions

🔹 Agent-guided extractive summarization (no text generation → no hallucination)

🔹 Statement-level explainability (every summary sentence maps to the source)

🔹 RL-optimized sentence selection using factual rewards

🔹 SLM-first design (5×–2000× cheaper than LLMs)

🔹 Edge-deployable inference pipeline
